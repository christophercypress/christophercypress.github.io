                <p>For the past couple of years, the video game industry has been at great conflict against the rise of various forms of predatory monetization practices from big named publishers. While the concept of predatory monetization has existed for several years, the metaphorical envelope has been pushed further and further to the point of it being pushed over the edge.</p>

                <br>
                <p>This started with the explosive popularity of monetizing loot boxes back in 2017; a form of content that, at the cost of a $1 to $3 (depending on the game), you will be randomly awarded in-game content that is usually exclusive to opening the box. You do not have control over what content you receive and because of their nature of having large tables of content determining what you receive and with the desirable items having a low chance of appearing upon opening, a player can go through several boxes without receiving any significant content. At first glance, this would not be so bad, because you would still receive <i>something</i>. However, unlike a baseball or trading card game card pack where you have something physically tangible in real life, this content is locked to the game (and typically locked to it’s online servers), and at any time if these servers shut down, the content is forever lost.</p>

                <br>
                <p>This unfortunately is not the part about this practice that is causing strife in the gaming community. Due to the randomization of content distribution and psychological hooks that are baked into the presentation of opening a loot box (resembling that of spinning a slot machine at a casino), the dangers of this method of generating revenue becomes quickly apparent. Companies that support these forms of revenue have been accused of exploiting their consumer’s psychological weaknesses and in recent times had light shed on what was once behind-the-scenes industry knowledge showing the kinds of lengths they would go to “make players into payers”!</p>

                <br>
                <p>I do not however feel this is all doom and gloom. While it is unfortunately it has gotten to the point where government regulation on how monetization occurs in video games had to occur, I think these same publisher still have a chance to change their ways and possibly win back the trust of gamers. One way this can be kicked off is by relying less on psychological traps, small purchases that are easy to do, but hard to keep track of, and giving the player the ability to buy directly what they want from the game’s store front. If big publishers can work together in offering us consumer friendly productions, and we as players give them the chance, the could be a wonderful future for gaming.!</p>
